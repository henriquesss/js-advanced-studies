## Testing

- npm t (native test suit of node.js || something around version 20)
- test fail cases before, success after
- test should not depend of the tester enviroment
- think in input and output first, processing and business rules after

### Mindset
- Don't put hands on code before know exactly what to do
- Have a enviroment fully configured, with hot reload, debugging and automated tests
- Everything you delivery needs to be validated throw automated tests
